# welcome!

This is the absolute base introduction to computer architecture.

In this overview, we will see what is computer architecture, how the layers of abstraction are set up, and why FPGAs are ideal for personal architectural exploration.

The foundations present here will move in higher difficulty across the modules present in this repository.

The basic prerequisites to this that we expect are basics of digital electronics, registers, wires, transistors (till CMOS at the least) etc.

In this repository, we will build our own CPU core (and further advance topics will cover even more!), from HDL to Bitstream flow, get detailed toolchain understanding!
